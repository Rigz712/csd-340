        <p><b>Courtney Huffer: From Zoo Keeper, to Beloved Groomer</b></p>
        <p>
            Courtney Huffer, 28, grew up in Springfield, Ohio, in a very stable environment with her loving
            parents Bob and Linda Dover. While surrounded by farm animals, this ignited her passion for animal care.
            Her parents pushed her to pursue her dreams, leading her to study at Otterbein University. There, she conducted 
            significant research on Hellbenders, enhancing their predatory response to benefit species survival. This research 
            was published, marking one of her proudest accomplishments to date. Additionally, Courtney had a brief but 
            rewarding career as a zookeeper for Gorillas and is now an awarded dog groomer and a member of the Poodle Club of America.
            Courtney's hobbies include grooming her dogs (Geralt, Zero, and Arya) as well as others, gardening in her wildflower garden, 
            and taking care of her six quails. She also enjoys reading and staying healthy through yoga, Pilates, and a balanced diet. 
            These activities make her feel full and give her a sense of accomplishment. Her love for animals began with her parents' farm 
            and extended to her studies and professional work, eventually finding a niche as a successful dog groomer.

            Currently, Courtney's primary goal is to step away from the professional world and focus on
            becoming a mother (no announcement yet **note she wanted me to mention that). She starts her days with a workout, followed by a healthy breakfast and daily vitamins. 
            Her days are filled with tasks like grooming dogs, gardening, and spending time with her family. In her free time, she 
            enjoys hikes with her husband, reading, and occasional doom-scrolling on Facebook.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Courtney values loyalty, honesty, and the balance between caring for animals and people. She
            believes in working hard to achieve her goals and always being open to new experiences. Her advice to her younger self 
            is to be less critical and embrace autonomy, understanding the importance of being kind to oneself.
